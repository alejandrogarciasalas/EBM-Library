# EBM-Library
Sometimes you just don't want the whole EBM boilerplate.

The EBM-Library is the EBM as it was originally conceived: A set of Sass partials and mixins to optimize development time.

Originally created by a good friend of mine [Gustavo Andr√©s Ibarra Martinez](https://github.com/netpoe) and adapted by me.
